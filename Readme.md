These are small Patch mods designed to work alongside the Compatibility Framework. They have many purposes, from providing a quick and easy patch between existing mods, to simply making small, inherently compatible changes to progressions or other CF-supported data.

## Includes

### Feats at Every 3 Levels
This small mod uses the Compatibiltiy Framework to patch progressions for vanilla classes, as well as those included in UnlockedLevelCurve, Artificer, Blood Hunter, and Mystic to provide feats every 3 levels, instead of every 4.

### Feats at Every 2 Levels
This small mod uses the Compatibiltiy Framework to patch progressions for vanilla classes, as well as those included in UnlockedLevelCurve, Artificer, Blood Hunter, and Mystic to provide feats every 2 levels, instead of every 4.

### CL Psionic Energy Dice Patch (TODO)
This small mod patches RoguesExtra and Psi Warrior to use the Psionic Energy Dice provided in Community Library, allowing both classes to synergize.

The Compatibility Framework makes it easy to set your mods up for compatibility with other mods, just by utilizing the Framework's API. To find out how, [check out the CF Wiki page](https://github.com/BG3-Community-Library-Team/BG3-Subclass-Compatibility-Framework/wiki/Adding-a-Subclass-to-the-Compatibility-Framework).

For more information on the Compatibility Framework API and JSON-based Config loading methods, take a look at the following pages:
- [Class/Subclass Module](https://github.com/BG3-Community-Library-Team/BG3-Subclass-Compatibility-Framework/wiki/_Class-Module)
- [Selector Module](https://github.com/BG3-Community-Library-Team/BG3-Subclass-Compatibility-Framework/wiki/_Selector-API)
- [Boosts/Passives Module](https://github.com/BG3-Community-Library-Team/BG3-Subclass-Compatibility-Framework/wiki/_Boosts-and-Passives)
- [Lists Module](https://github.com/BG3-Community-Library-Team/BG3-Subclass-Compatibility-Framework/wiki/_Lists-API)

## Installation
This mod works with [Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), and possibly Vortex and Manual
Installations. BG3 Mod Managers is by far the simplest method, and as such is recommended one.
